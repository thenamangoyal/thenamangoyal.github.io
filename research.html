                    Technology, IIT Ropar on prediction of a knowledge gap in the text is a long-standing challenge, defined as the
                    identification of regions in the text where the information presented lacks clarity or
                    coherence. An automated pipeline to predict such gaps would be high applicability in
                    generating feedback and refining the text for school books, education, learning, and other
                    areas of documentation and research.</p>
                <p class="lead">Developed novel approach for decomposing the problem of knowledge gap into two
                    separate tasks, first segmenting
                    a given text document and then predicting the external and internal
                    gap.

                    <li class="lead">For segmenting a given text such
                        that a given segment consists of all consecutive sentences of similar
                        context is based on semantic similarity of sentences.

                    <li class="lead">The next task
                        of predicting the internal gap for a given segment is modelled from

                        the perspective of ease of readability, and various metrics are
                        contrasted for same. Predicting an external gap between the two pieces

                        of segmented text works on evaluating the generated probability distribution of topics.

                    We then obtain protocol based on analysis of information which combines techniques like

                    The effect is a greatly distributed and asynchronous protocol which greatly restrict the
